# Unofficial Kayo Desktop App

Disclaimer: This is in no way affiliated with Kayo, I am using this to watch sport without a browser.

This app allows you to watch Kayo on the Desktop without a browser. Currently only live events are supported, but much more can easily be added.

## Download

Download this app from the 'Releases' tab in GitHub (or you can compile it yourself)

[Latest release here](https://github.com/etopiei/kayo/releases/latest)

## Development

To get started developing:

1. Clone Repo
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start`

## Roadmap - v1.0 Release

 - UI Improvements (it looks pretty questionable atm)
 - Add Kayo features to app
 - Enhance 'desktop' abilities (caching credentials, saving last sport watched, menu options)
 - Video Controls
 - 'From live' or 'From Start' options

## License + Thanks

This app was made possible by the Kayo Kodi Plugin by Matt Huisman.

Which can be viewed [here](https://github.com/wrxtasy/plugin.video.kayo.sports/)

All the work to figure out Kayo's API and how the service works was done by him, and the requests I'm making in this app are based on this repo.

## FAQ

Q: 'Without a browser', who are you kidding? This is an electron app, you can't fool me!

A: That's not technically a question, but yeah you're right I pulled this together pretty quickly and it gets the job done. It's nice to be able to seperate Kayo from other browser tabs.

Q: Why doesn't this support [feature X]?

A: It doesn't yet, but development is active, and you can help too! Open an Issue or Create a Pull Request and I'll work on it soon.
